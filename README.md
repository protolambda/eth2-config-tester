# Eth2 config tester

The goals is to make configs:
- Simple to parse, key-value
- Valid YAML, but no advanced features
- Compatible, no unexpected or missing keys
- Consistent, no formatting differences
- Minimal, no super long names 
- Familiar, use common (within ethereum) 0x prefix for bytes
- Structured, prefer a specific order of config keys
- Bare, no inline comments, head/foot comments are ok.
- Standard, following a spec for the config
